1.4-SNAPSHOT:
file changes:
 - settings.yml - now version 3 - [link]
 - messages.yml - now version 2 - [link]

notes:
 - data.yml hasn't changed in structure, but player balances are now stored to a rounded format.
 - It is recommended you reset the file if you can so old balances will be rounded.
 - As players make transactions, their old balance will become rounded though.
 - Thus I didn't update the data.json version :)

changes:
 - [issue #7, #8, #5] redone a massive portion of the plugin. everything except for the main class and utility classes have been scrapped and redone.
  - plugin is now fully dependent on Vault. It's a great API so I decided it couldn't hurt to become dependent on it.
  - completely changed the settings.yml and messages.yml file.
   - the files have changed from the ground up. they're filled to the brim with comments, so I doubt you'll ever get confused of what an option does.
   - you can now use both a symbol and a word in currency formatting.
 - after a high demand and long wait, I have added in /pay and /baltop
  - usages:
   - /pay <player> <amount>
   - /baltop
 - after an extreme demand, including one from the Trump administration, I have added in /phantomeconomy. This revolutionary command shows you the version of the plugin you have installed.
